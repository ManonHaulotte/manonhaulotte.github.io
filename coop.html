                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> The Co-operators, a major Canadian insurance company, approached us with a critical challenge:
Redesign the onboarding flow for first-time drivers purchasing car insurance — a demographic that is digital-first, expects intuitive experiences, and has little to no familiarity with the complexities of insurance.

Our mission was to a traditionally complex, legally heavy process feel approachable, clear, and empowering for young drivers.

As the lead UX designer on this project, I was responsible for:
                        - Conducting user research (card sorting, interviews, usability tests)
                        - Leading information architecture (IA) restructuring
                        - Building prototypes at multiple fidelities
                        - Working cross-functionally with developers, SMEs (subject matter experts), and key business stakeholders
                        - Participating actively in Agile Scrum ceremonies (daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives)

 <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                    Buying car insurance is overwhelming for anyone — but especially for first-time drivers.
The biggest UX challenges were:
High information density: Legal, regulatory, and educational content needed to be included for compliance.

Low user familiarity: First-time drivers had no mental model for the process.

Cross-department collaboration: Legal, marketing, underwriting, and sales teams all had competing requirements.

Need for trust: Insurance is a high-trust purchase, and the onboarding flow needed to inspire confidence.
             </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                       So we collaborated with our users to redefine the information architecture:
Through open and closed card sorting sessions (in-person), we uncovered:
                        - Users did not want information grouped around company-internal categories.
                        - Terminology like "deductible" and "endorsement" was confusing; needed plain language layering.
                        - Legal information needed to be accessible but not overwhelm the screen.                    
                    
                    </p>

                    
                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
 <b>We mapped out an entirely new information architecture focused on a progressive disclosure model — revealing information only when needed to reduce cognitive load.

                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                         We implemented a design system where:

Key choices were surfaced simply, with optional deep dives.

Legal language was summarized in plain English first, with the option to “Read Full Policy” for transparency.

Visual hierarchies (typography, spacing, color) were strictly enforced to guide attention. </p>
                          <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                         I proceeded with sketches, then wireframes, and refined the solution with three rounds of usability testing. In total, 14 people tried the prototype (at different levels of fidelity). I would start with some background questions about their experience with academic papers, then ask them to perform a task (enter their interests - select a paper - read it, while I observe their reaction, and lastly inquire about their general opinion. The goal was to validate that the design was intuitive, that the content was enjoyable to read and easy to grasp and that people would indeed be more inclined to read academic papers if they were presented in such format. The feedback I got was incredibly helpful. For example:</p>
                          <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                                <ul class="list-style-3 text-medium line-height-30 padding-20px-left">
                                    <li> The Home Page ("Discover") is an important one, as it should make users feel curious but not overwhelmed. I started with a very simple list, which people found too cluttered and not inspiring. I then tried a carousel, to focus on one paper at the time, with little success: it was confusing and cumbersome. I ended up with something in between: the user can scroll down to see different sections, and swipe for the papers within each categories. The feedback was positive: this layout was intuitive and well-organised. Thanks to the testings, I also learned what information actually needed to be on this page: the reading time and the option to pick up where you left off were appreciated, while the year of publication and tags were just cluttering the screen. Finally, I realised that the "Read" button wasn't necessary, because with well-designed interface the users would intuitively click on the card.</li>
                                        
                                       <li> I spent a lot of time trying and testing different layouts for the paper itself, to ensure it was enjoyable to read and easy to understand. One of the main learning outcome was that people like the ability to customize their reading experience (font, size, background colour,...), so I opted for a minimalist default layout, with sufficient spacing. Beside, while my first design was an overwhelming one-page text, the response was much better for the final option: each page presents one main idea/concept, the user can swipe from one page to the next, and a bar at the bottom indicates progress. People also loved the option to get a definition by clicking on a term, without having to leave the paper page.
                                </li>

                                    <li> A big hurdle with the two first prototypes was learnability. I therefore carefully read Apple's Human Interface Guidelines before designing the final prototype, to make sure the app looked familiar and users didn't have to learn new pattern. That made the biggest difference: people I then tested went through the task flow without any confusion or hesitation.</li>

                                </ul></p>
                                <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                             
                        The final feedback was very enthusiastic: people confirmed that they would use the app, appreciated the intutive interface and felt immersed in the paper: “<i>It can take so long sometimes to get to the relevant part in a paper, I like that this is short and straight to the point, but not too superficial </i>”.</p>

As academia is often perceived to be obscure and intimadating, I wanted a brand that appeared friendly and modern, but also trustworthy.  </p>

                        <p class="text-medium line-height-30">  This is what I aimed to convey on the marketing website as well, with a minimalist layout, one-line illustrations and clear explanations. While we were only asked to design the page, I wanted to bring biblio to life and decided to code it. Although the result is far from perfect, as I only had two days to work on it, I enjoyed the challenge and people liked interacting with the website when we showcased our projects.

                                I felt proud at the end of this project: I had managed to take a complex issue through a 2 months design process and was getting a lot of positive feedback for the final product. I had also learned a lot: how to listen to users instead of blindly following my first ideas, how to focus on perfecting the core flow rather than wanting to "design it all", how to trust the process and not get so attached to my initial designs, how to keep going when it gets overwhelming, etc.</p>

                        <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> However, there's still so much to be improved. With the flow, design and copy of both the app and the website of course, but more importantly, I need to start including researchers. Indeed, academia still operate under an ancient system that values only scholarly output and has yet to find an incentive for researchers to engage the public. Even when they want to, they might not know how or simply not have the time. By working with academics, I could better grasp the complexities of their process and uncover what would encourage them to share their findings with the wider audience in an accessible format.
