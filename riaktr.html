                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> Riaktr's SaaS platform assists managers in the telecommunications industry in Africa and Latin America to improve their distribution and sales management. The web app enables managers to <b> monitor their team, assign tasks, manage inventory and access important metrics </b> related to their points of sale. The user interface is designed to provide users with data-driven insights to make informed decisions.

                    </br></br> 
                  

                    As the first designer on the team, I collaborated with a small cross-functional agile team (six developers and one product manager) to redesign the software and improve key user flows. Conducting remote user research and taking into account legacy and technical constraints, I worked closely with the team to establish a shared vision and implement it incrementally. I also focused on improving the visual consistency of the app, and testing new design concepts to improve visibility of information on a data-heavy interface. 
                                    
             </br></br> 
             Additionally, I identified opportunities to improve the design process and led the implementation of those changes, including creating and promoting a design system, increasing the visibility of user research, and aligning design efforts with developers' sprints.

    The company had experienced rapid growth and relied heavily on developers to handle design tasks. To meet client demands, new features were added without proper consideration for their impact on the overall user experience. This led to disorganized and complex user flows, resulting in a cluttered interface that lacked consistency and personality. At that time, the platform was transitioning platforms, from "Control Tower" to "Sales & Distribution" (S&D), requiring users to switch between platforms to complete tasks.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Upon joining the Riaktr team, my primary focus was to identify key areas for improvement. I analyzed the information architecture of both platforms, and during a workshop, we developed a vision for a more task-based IA, leveraging insights from existing user research and internal knowledge. Through user research, stakeholder interviews, and workshops, we determined that enhancing the end-to-end flow of creating new tasks within the S&D platform was the first step toward improving the user experience. 
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    At the core of S&D is the POI (Point of Interest, or point of sale), which is the primary unit that managers need to act upon to create a positive impact within their sales organization. Riaktr proposes to clients the centralization of dozens of data points on these points of sale, which are often only available through inconsistent Excel files, lacking a single source of knowledge.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Interviews with internal stakeholders, particularly the sales teams working closely with clients, revealed that the first end-to-end flow to focus on for maximum value and quick delivery was the task assignment to the field team. This flow includes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Overview of POIs and selecting relevant ones to act upon</li>
    <li>Choosing the task to address issues</li>
    <li>Assigning tasks to agents</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    The business goals for this project were to enable action based on analytics, reduce the churn rate, and ultimately phase out the Control Tower. The POI Explorer was designed as a flexible tool to serve various use cases across different industries, making it industry-agnostic.
</p>

    I developed a series of concept designs and prototypes, testing them with users and iterating based on their feedback. Collaborating closely with the team, we established a shared vision for the redesign and prioritized changes according to technical constraints, user research insights, and client expectations. Additionally, I conducted a usability review of the entire app, analyzed the information architecture, and made recommendations for improvement.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    I began building a design system to create a consistent visual language for the platform, working with developers to ensure feasibility and co-ownership of components. Throughout the redesign process, I partnered with the project manager to enhance our design and research methods and align design and development efforts effectively.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
   We also conducted remote interviews with managers and field agents in Africa to understand their pain points and gather feedback on the current task creation process. This involved semi-structured qualitative interviews lasting about one hour, along with reviewing existing research and data to identify areas for improvement.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    They clarified the context of work for our users, which differs significantly from what we were familiar with in the team. A point of sale may be a traveling cart on the side of a road, and operations often relied on relationships and informal communication. We learned a lot about the various profiles of users of the Sales & Distribution platform, based on the frequency of usage and key tasks:
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>User Types:</strong> <ul>
    <li>
    Daily users </li>
    <li>
    Several times a week </li>
    <li>
    Several times a month </li>
    <li>
    Once a month or less</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>Key Tasks:</strong> 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>View an overview of their key KPIs</li>
    <li>Create tasks for field agents to quickly address performance issues</li>
    <li>Monitor tasks and field agents</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
      <strong>Our key findings included:</strong> 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some countries have specific needs, requiring tailored selection criteria during implementation.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintaining a sense of autonomy is essential;</strong> managers have extensive external knowledge about agent capabilities and operational zones, and they desire access to information for decision-making.</li>
    <li>Internal communication between agents and managers often occurs through platforms like WhatsApp, with varying levels of trust across countries.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    These insights allowed us to identify <strong>missed opportunities:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An alerting system for operational issues.</li>
    <li>Categorizing types of Points of Interest (POIs).</li>
    <li>Automating simple tasks (e.g., sending surveys to POIs) so field agents can focus on more critical responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Additionally, we proposed the following improvements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eliminate the context switch between S&D and Control Tower (CT).</li>
    <li>Equip managers with filters to make informed decisions regarding which POIs. to include/exclude (e.g., last visit date, segment).</li>
    <li>Enhance the POI list to display the number of selected items.</li>
    <li>Enable users to create tasks where they can specify survey details, due dates, and perform bulk actions like reassigning or deleting tasks.</li>
    <li>Implement a tasks widget to track the status of created tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>Key Questions our redesign will need to answer:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How intuitive is the new flow?</li>
    <li>Can users quickly and easily create tasks, focusing on the most relevant <strong>POIs</strong>? (e.g., avoiding checkboxes for selection and automatically batch-selecting based on criteria).</li>
    <li>How can we better define design components for various selection criteria, especially when dealing with a large number of options?</li>
</ul>

    We proceded with a card sorting exercise to understand users' workflows and priorities. Their approach typically followed a step-by-step logic: first identifying performance issues, then locating them geographically, then prioritizing tasks, and finally assigning them to field agents. This helped us define an "Overview to Action" flow, where users could seamlessly move from identifying key insights to taking operational steps. Within this framework, users' actions fell into three main categories: monitoring field work (including following up on tasks and communicating with agents), analyzing information to uncover issues or growth opportunities, and managing their Points of Sale (such as editing details or reviewing statuses).
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    To address the major pain points, we explored a variety of design improvements. Key changes included removing the disruptive context switch between S&D and CT, providing managers with smarter filters to help them select or exclude POIs more effectively, and creating a POI list that showed the number of selected items at a glance. We also tested both micro and macro-interactions to ensure that the new task creation flow was intuitive, fast, and user-friendly.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    To validate the initial designs, we conducted 13 user interviews alongside 3 internal interviews. The primary objective was to verify whether the new task creation process helped managers better target key Points of Sale, both for immediate problem-solving (firefighting) and for longer-term growth strategies.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>Key Findings:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Users reported that the process is now easier and less time-consuming, successfully addressing main frustrations such as the previous lack of essential POS attributes (e.g., Segment, Last visited).</li>
        <li>The POS list could become even more intuitive by enabling batch selection based on set criteria automatically.</li>
        <li>Some countries are missing critical information such as open tasks, owner names, distributor names, revenues, and recent surveys, which will need to be addressed.</li>
        <li>Minor UI improvements were suggested, such as displaying the number of selected POS higher up on the page and enabling a disabled "Create Task" button before any selections are made.</li>
        <li>The "Save Filter Set" feature was found unnecessary and will be reconsidered.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>The New Design Will Feature:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Quick Filters displayed in a left-hand panel, allowing users to easily switch between different types of POIs.</li>
        <li>Advanced Filters accessible through a modal window, offering more precise targeting options.</li>
        <li>Customized selection criteria for each country, ensuring local operational relevance during implementation.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>Engineering Feedback:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Task breakdown for Milestone 1 will kickstart development efforts.</li>
        <li>Multiple design iterations will likely be necessary to accommodate technical constraints and performance optimizations.</li>
        <li>Given the need for quick delivery, developers will handle part of the UI work independently, consulting me for guidance. Meanwhile, I will focus on building out the design system to support long-term UI scalability and consistency.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    A major obstacle throughout this process was the lack of a proper design component library. Having to create UI patterns "on the fly" led to inconsistencies across the product and caused unnecessary inefficiencies within the team. Before moving too quickly, particularly with the launch of the new POI Explorer, I strongly recommended taking a step back to assess our components, consolidate key use cases, and collaboratively build a flexible and scalable component library. This would serve as the foundation of a broader design system, ultimately enabling faster and more coherent design-to-development handoffs. Additionally, too much time was lost in redundant back-and-forth between design, business, and development teams. To address this moving forward, we will emphasize better co-creation practices, more transparency, regular design critique sessions, and earlier input from business and technical stakeholders.
