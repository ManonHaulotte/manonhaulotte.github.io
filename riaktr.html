                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> Riaktr's SaaS platform assists managers in the telecommunications industry in Africa and Latin America to improve their distribution and sales management. The web app enables managers to <b> monitor their team, assign tasks, manage inventory and access important metrics </b> related to their points of sale. The user interface is designed to provide users with data-driven insights to make informed decisions.

                    </br></br> 
                  

                    As the first designer on the team, I collaborated with a small cross-functional agile team (six developers and one product manager) to redesign the software and improve key user flows. Conducting remote user research and taking into account legacy and technical constraints, I worked closely with the team to establish a shared vision and implement it incrementally. I also focused on improving the visual consistency of the app, and testing new design concepts to improve visibility of information on a data-heavy interface. 
                                    
             </br></br> 
             Additionally, I identified opportunities to improve the design process and led the implementation of those changes, including creating and promoting a design system, increasing the visibility of user research, and aligning design efforts with developers' sprints.

                     <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    The company had experienced rapid growth and relied heavily on developers to handle design tasks. To meet client demands, new features were added without proper consideration for their impact on the overall user experience. This led to disorganized and complex user flows, resulting in a cluttered interface that lacked consistency and personality. At that time, the platform was transitioning platforms, from "Control Tower" to "Sales & Distribution" (S&D), requiring users to switch between platforms to complete tasks.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Upon joining the Riaktr team, my primary focus was to identify key areas for improvement. I analyzed the information architecture of both platforms, and during a workshop, we developed a vision for a more task-based IA, leveraging insights from existing user research and internal knowledge. Through user research, stakeholder interviews, and workshops, we determined that enhancing the end-to-end flow of creating new tasks within the S&D platform was the first step toward improving the user experience. 
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    At the core of S&D is the POI (Point of Interest, or point of sale), which is the primary unit that managers need to act upon to create a positive impact within their sales organization. Riaktr proposes to clients the centralization of dozens of data points on these points of sale, which are often only available through inconsistent Excel files, lacking a single source of knowledge.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Interviews with internal stakeholders, particularly the sales teams working closely with clients, revealed that the first end-to-end flow to focus on for maximum value and quick delivery was the task assignment to the field team. This flow includes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Overview of POIs and selecting relevant ones to act upon</li>
    <li>Choosing the task to address issues</li>
    <li>Assigning tasks to agents</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    The business goals for this project were to enable action based on analytics, reduce the churn rate, and ultimately phase out the Control Tower. The POI Explorer was designed as a flexible tool to serve various use cases across different industries, making it industry-agnostic.

    I developed a series of concept designs and prototypes, testing them with users and iterating based on their feedback. Collaborating closely with the team, we established a shared vision for the redesign and prioritized changes according to technical constraints, user research insights, and client expectations. Additionally, I conducted a usability review of the entire app, analyzed the information architecture, and made recommendations for improvement.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    I began building a design system to create a consistent visual language for the platform, working with developers to ensure feasibility and co-ownership of components. Throughout the redesign process, I partnered with the project manager to enhance our design and research methods and align design and development efforts effectively.
</p>

<h3>Discovery and Research</h3>
<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
   We also conducted remote interviews with managers and field agents to understand their pain points and gather feedback on the current task creation process. This involved semi-structured qualitative interviews lasting about one hour, along with reviewing existing research and data to identify areas for improvement.
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    They clarified the context of work for our users, which differs significantly from what we were familiar with in the team. A point of sale may be a traveling cart on the side of a road, and operations often relied on relationships and informal communication. We learned a lot about the various profiles of users of the Sales & Distribution platform, based on the frequency of usage and key tasks:
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>User Types:</strong> 
    - Daily users 
    - Several times a week 
    - Several times a month 
    - Once a month or less
</p>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>Key Tasks:</strong> 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>View an overview of their key KPIs</li>
    <li>Create tasks for field agents to quickly address performance issues</li>
    <li>Monitor tasks and field agents</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Our key findings included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some countries have specific needs, requiring tailored selection criteria during implementation.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintaining a sense of autonomy is essential;</strong> managers have extensive external knowledge about agent capabilities and operational zones, and they desire access to information for decision-making.</li>
    <li>Internal communication between agents and managers often occurs through platforms like WhatsApp, with varying levels of trust across countries.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    These insights allowed us to identify <strong>missed opportunities:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An alerting system for operational issues.</li>
    <li>Categorizing types of Points of Interest (POIs).</li>
    <li>Automating simple tasks (e.g., sending surveys to POIs) so field agents can focus on more critical responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    Additionally, we proposed the following improvements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eliminate the context switch between S&D and Control Tower (CT).</li>
    <li>Equip managers with filters to make informed decisions regarding which POIs. to include/exclude (e.g., last visit date, segment).</li>
    <li>Enhance the POI list to display the number of selected items.</li>
    <li>Enable users to create tasks where they can specify survey details, due dates, and perform bulk actions like reassigning or deleting tasks.</li>
    <li>Implement a tasks widget to track the status of created tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-medium line-height-30">
    <strong>Key Questions our redesign will need to answer:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How intuitive is the new flow?</li>
    <li>Can users quickly and easily create tasks, focusing on the most relevant <strong>POIs</strong>? (e.g., avoiding checkboxes for selection and automatically batch-selecting based on criteria).</li>
    <li>How can we better define design components for various selection criteria, especially when dealing with a large number of options?</li>
</ul>

                        The team explored various design solutions to address the identified pain points, such as removing the context switch from S&D to CT, equipping managers with necessary filters to make informed choices about which POIs to include/exclude, and creating a POI list with the number of selected POIs. They also tested micro and macro interactions to ensure the new task creation flow was intuitive and easy to use. - the selection criterias - the list Design decisions: Based on the research and testing, the team decided to implement a new task creation flow that included features such as filters, a POI explorer, and a task widget to track the status of created tasks.
                        
                        13 user interviews (and 3 internal interviews) were conducted to 
                        confront the initial designs. 
                        
                        Does the new task creation flow make it easy for managers to ensure that their team is focusing on the key Points of Sales, both when acting on specific issues (firefighting) and when driving growth? Firefighting/list view: we’re going in the right direction. • Users find the process easier, less time-consuming and were glad to see their main pain points answered, like including the POS attributes they need to make a selection (Segment, Last visited,...

                        POS List (Serious): • Can be made more intuitive by automatically batch-selecting POIs based on selection criterias • Missing information for some countries: Open tasks, owner name, distributor name, revenues, last survey conducted.... • UI tweaks: Show number of POS higher on the page, show the disabled “create task” icon before selection,... • The “save filters set” was not a requested feature.

Before moving forward too fast, especially with the creation of the new  POI explorer, I would strongly recommend taking a step back, assessing our various components, as well as our key use cases, and taking the time to create a flexible and adapted components library, together with design and development, with the vision of slowly moving towards a design system, that would ultimately enable a much faster design-to-development process. Time was also lost due to the (too) many back-and-forth between design, business and development.   Moving forward, efforts will be made to ensure better co-creation, more transparency, frequent design critique sessions and earlier input from business and technical

                    Noticing the growing lack of consistency, the question of moving towards a design system was discussed with design, business and development

                        
                        
                    They also decided to focus on creating a design system to improve the consistency and efficiency of the design process. Next steps: The next step is to create a POI explorer and design components library, with a focus on creating a flexible and adapted components library, together with design and development, with the vision of slowly moving towards a design system that would ultimately enable a much faster design-to-development process. Additionally, efforts will be made to ensure better co-creation, more transparency, frequent design critique sessions and earlier input from business and technical teams.

card sorting exercice: based on their workflow, priorities. "I work step by step: identify the performance issues, then the location, then the tasks, then the agents"

Overivew to Action logic. Those actions fall under: 1. Monitor the work done on the field, including following up on the tasks created and interacting with field agents 2. Understand to identify issues or growth opportunities 3. Managing their POS (edit, see details,...hahah)

                    We therefore moved to the ideation exercice with those questions in mind:

                    <ul class="list-style-3 text-medium line-height-30 padding-20px-left">
                        <li>  How might we facilitate the users’ recurring tasks? </li>
                        
                        <li>   How might we meet the users’ personalization needs?</li>

                        <li> How might we prompt the users to connect every day to BelfiusWeb?
                        </li>
                        <li>  How might we continuously provide content that’s relevant to each user?
                        </li>
                    

                    </ul>
                </br></br>
                <p class="text-medium line-height-30">

                  After the final workshop, we had defined the vision and quick-wins. While the goal was to provide relevant content and anticipate users' needs, we would start with a dashboard that could be manually personalized and that'd include: shortcuts to top tasks, recent activity (alerts, notifications, documents to sign,…), an overview on relevant accounts and communications from the bank.  The second step would be to offer decision makers an actionable overview of the company's financial health and growth with relevant KPIs.
                  
                </br></br>
I went back to my laptop to design the initial concepts. There was a lot of back and forth over the next couple of months. I collaborated with the marketing team and UI designer <a href="https://www.behance.net/swinchri/appreciated" target="_blank">Christian Swinnen</a> to arrive at the final UI, as well as the research team to verify our assumptions and better define users' key tasks and workflows. I also worked closely with IT and Data to ensure the solution was future-proof. And I had to frequently validate the direction with the management team, as well as with the legal and security teams. Until, at last the final version was launched, with a lot of positive feedback from the users.

                            My mission at Belfius lasted a year and it is to date the one I found the most interesting and challenging. Processes were slow, the meetings long, the politics complicated and I had to work hard to prove the value of shifting towards a more user-centric approach. But looking back, I thrived in the complexity and the autonomy, I got to be challenged by brilliant UXers and work with finance experts. I learned a lot about stakeholder management and how to communicate design decisions. It helps that I received, and still do, positive feedback from both users and former coworkers.
