                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> Riaktr's SaaS platform assists managers in the telecommunications industry in Africa and Latin America to improve their distribution and sales management. The web app enables managers to monitor their team, assign tasks, manage inventory and access important metrics related to their points of sale. The user interface is designed to provide users with data-driven insights to make informed decisions.

                    </br></br> 
                  

                    As the first designer on the team, I collaborated with a small cross-functional agile team (six developers and one product manager) to redesign the software and improve key user flows. Conducting remote user research and taking into account legacy and technical constraints, I worked closely with the team to establish a shared vision and implement it incrementally. I also focused on improving the visual consistency of the app, and testing new design concepts to improve visibility of information on a data-heavy interface. 
                                    
             </br></br> 
             Additionally, I identified opportunities to improve the design process and led the implementation of those changes, including creating and promoting a design system, increasing the visibility of user research, and aligning design efforts with developers' sprints.

                            the company experienced rapid growth and relied on developers to handle design tasksand added various features as clients requested them "on the fly" , resulting in disorganized and complex user flows and a cluttered interface that lacked visual consistency and personality. The platform was in the middle of changing from “Control Tower” to “S&D” and there was a need to improve the overall user experience. When I joined the Riaktr team it was in the middle of changing platform from “control tower” to “s&d”. As a first step towards deprecating Control Tower and to improve the overal user experience, we are moving the end-to-end flow of creating new tasks to S&D. This flow will be implemented step by step, ultimately resulting in the creation of a new app, the POI Explorer, where POIs can be filtered and selected for various actions. the business goal was ”A flexible exploration tool to select POI for action. It should be industry-agnostic and be able to serve different use cases for different industries ”

                Business goals: enable action based on analytics, reduce churn rate and deprecate control tower 

                My first priority was to address the most pressing needs and issues, which involved conducting user research (remotely) to better understand our users' various goals and contexts. I then worked on a series of concept designs and prototypes, testing them with users and iterating based on their feedback. I worked closely with the team to establish a shared vision for the redesign and prioritize changes based on technical constraints, user research insights, and client expectations. In addition to this, I conducted a usability review of the entire app, analyzed the information architecture, and made recommendations for improvement. I then began building a design system to create a consistent visual language for the platform, working closely with developers to ensure the feasibility and co-ownership of the components. Throughout the redesign process, I worked closely with the project manager to improve our design and research processes, and to align design and development efforts effectively

                        Discovery and Research: The team conducted interviews with managers and field agents to understand their pain points and gather feedback on the current task creation process. They also looked at existing research and data to identify areas that needed improvement. research method: remote interviews
                       internal interviews (sales team and customer support very close to client) and zoom calls to understand needs 1h long semi scripted qualitative interviews. the reality of working in those countries is very different from the one we know, a point of sale could me a travelling cart on the side of the road. A lot is based on relationships and informal communication. 
                       
                        findings: Some countries have specific needs -> selection criterias will need to be configured during implementation Maintaining a sense of autonomy seems important. • The managers we talked to have a lot of external knowledge (about the tasks each agents can handle, the zone they work in,...). They want to have access to all the necessary information to make their own decisions. • There’s ongoing internal communication between the agents and the managers (Whatsapp,...). The level of trust do vary from country to country though.

                        By: - Removing context switch from S&D to CT - Equipping managers with the necessary filters to make informed choices about which POS to include/exclude (last visit date, segment,…) - POI list with number of POIs selected - Create Task: users can determine the survey and due date, (bulk-) reassign, (bulk-) delete and comment tasks. - Tasks Widget: tracks status of created tasks How intuitive is the new flow? Are users able to quickly and easily create task, focusing on the most relevant POIs? e.g..: not using checkboxes to select a line, automatically batch-selecting POIs based on selection criterias,… Filters Better define the design components for various selection criterias. E.g.: What happens when there are hundreds of options to choose from? (field agents…)

                        The team explored various design solutions to address the identified pain points, such as removing the context switch from S&D to CT, equipping managers with necessary filters to make informed choices about which POIs to include/exclude, and creating a POI list with the number of selected POIs. They also tested micro and macro interactions to ensure the new task creation flow was intuitive and easy to use. - the selection criterias - the list Design decisions: Based on the research and testing, the team decided to implement a new task creation flow that included features such as filters, a POI explorer, and a task widget to track the status of created tasks.
                        
                        13 user interviews (and 3 internal interviews) were conducted to

                        Does the new task creation flow make it easy for managers to ensure that their team is focusing on the key Points of Sales, both when acting on specific issues (firefighting) and when driving growth? Firefighting/list view: we’re going in the right direction. • Users find the process easier, less time-consuming and were glad to see their main pain points answered, like including the POS attributes they need to make a selection (Segment, Last visited,...

                    A massive block thorough this process has been the lack of adequate design components. The creation of new UI patterns ”on the fly” lead to both inconsistencies in the product and wasted time within the team. Before moving forward too fast, especially with the creation of the new  POI explorer, I would strongly recommend taking a step back, assessing our various components, as well as our key use cases, and taking the time to create a flexible and adapted components library, together with design and development, with the vision of slowly moving towards a design system, that would ultimately enable a much faster design-to-development process. Time was also lost due to the (too) many back-and-forth between design, business and development.   Moving forward, efforts will be made to ensure better co-creation, more transparency, frequent design critique sessions and earlier input from business and technical

                            I had to do a lot of convincing and stakeholder management to launch this project, as this was not on the roadmap, and Belfius was still operating in a top-down approach when it came to design priorities. 

                        </br></br>

                        To do so, I involved the whole team, as well as external experts (corporate bankers and customer support team) in a process of co-creation.<b>In total, I facilitated 4 workshops to: define the business value of the idea (impact map), better understand the users’ needs and workflow (provisional personas), generate ideas and determine the ideal vision state, prioritize our ideas and agree on intermediary steps (impact vs effort matrix)</b>  </br></br> </br> </br>

                       At the end of the second exercice, we had 3 profiles with specific but different tasks and needs, yet all using the same tool with the same request: <b>to only see what’s relevant for them, with as little unnecessary steps and clutter as possible.</b></p>

                    We therefore moved to the ideation exercice with those questions in mind:

                    <ul class="list-style-3 text-medium line-height-30 padding-20px-left">
                        <li>  How might we facilitate the users’ recurring tasks? </li>
                        
                        <li>   How might we meet the users’ personalization needs?</li>

                        <li> How might we prompt the users to connect every day to BelfiusWeb?
                        </li>
                        <li>  How might we continuously provide content that’s relevant to each user?
                        </li>
                    

                    </ul>
                </br></br>
                <p class="text-medium line-height-30">

                  After the final workshop, we had defined the vision and quick-wins. While the goal was to provide relevant content and anticipate users' needs, we would start with a dashboard that could be manually personalized and that'd include: shortcuts to top tasks, recent activity (alerts, notifications, documents to sign,…), an overview on relevant accounts and communications from the bank.  The second step would be to offer decision makers an actionable overview of the company's financial health and growth with relevant KPIs.
                  
                </br></br>
I went back to my laptop to design the initial concepts. There was a lot of back and forth over the next couple of months. I collaborated with the marketing team and UI designer <a href="https://www.behance.net/swinchri/appreciated" target="_blank">Christian Swinnen</a> to arrive at the final UI, as well as the research team to verify our assumptions and better define users' key tasks and workflows. I also worked closely with IT and Data to ensure the solution was future-proof. And I had to frequently validate the direction with the management team, as well as with the legal and security teams. Until, at last the final version was launched, with a lot of positive feedback from the users.

                            My mission at Belfius lasted a year and it is to date the one I found the most interesting and challenging. Processes were slow, the meetings long, the politics complicated and I had to work hard to prove the value of shifting towards a more user-centric approach. But looking back, I thrived in the complexity and the autonomy, I got to be challenged by brilliant UXers and work with finance experts. I learned a lot about stakeholder management and how to communicate design decisions. It helps that I received, and still do, positive feedback from both users and former coworkers.
