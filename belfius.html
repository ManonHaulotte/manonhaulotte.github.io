                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> Belfius is the leading Belgian bank, and their private banking app ranks high with customers,  thanks to a great design team. 
                    </br></br> 
                  

                    However, one department was having issues: the PCB team, who develops and maintains the digital solutions for corporate and public banking. They had been collaborating with an external agency to redesign their web app for the past 2 years. It should be noted that we're talking about a platform that people in various financial roles (accountants, CFOs, investments managers,…) and in companies ranging from small local businesses to multimillion international corporations need to use to complete their daily tasks. Unclear navigation or poor user experience therefore means time lost during the work day, constant frustration for the employees, and real financial consequences for our clients.
                
             </br></br> 
             Unfortunately, the redesign had prioritized the look and feel, with little to no consideration for user needs and context. The big launch was not going as planned: users were confused by the new version of BelfiusWeb, the support team was receiving too many calls every day and corporate clients weren't happy. </p>
    
    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> 
          That's when I was brought on board. It was the first time a UX designer would work with this team and on this product.</p>

                 For a month, I mostly observed. I worked on small design tasks while getting to know the many stakeholders, asking many questions to the user researchers and the customer support team, learning from the domain experts, and familiarizing myself with the complex and multilayered platform. It became obvious that the product reflected the team organization: <b>different stakeholders with varying visions were working in silos, domain and user knowledge was scattered accross departments, and a proper design process needed to be formalized.</b>
</br>       </br> 
So I got the team together, with some key external stakeholders, and we defined <b>five design principles</b> for BelfiusWeb. Not only was this a fun workshop to facilitate, it also created a shared design vision that everyone felt they could own, introduced a different way of working, and proved tremendously helpful with decision-making later on.

                            Armed with the team's shared design vision, as well as a set of heuristics and insights from previous user research, I began a thorough usability evaluation of BelfiusWeb.
                        </br>       </br> 
                            This shared document informed future design efforts and pointed to a critical issue: the way information was organized (information architecture), connected (primary navigation), and contextualized (local navigation) on BelfiusWeb was causing a lot of friction. Because the navigation hadn't been informed by researched-backed user journeys, users had to bounce back and forth between pages to complete their tasks.
                    

                            <p class="text-light-gray text-medium line-height-30">
                            A (sad) fun fact to illustrate this: when a colleague visited one of our client's office, he reported that one employee had a sticky note next to her laptop, where she'd written the step-by-step path to follow to complete her key tasks on the app.

                        This audit highlighted another underlying problem: <b> a lack of first-hand knowledge and contextual understanding of what users need, how they work, what their frustrations are, etc. </b>

                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> 
                        I mentioned earlier that we were designing a professional tool that had to enable a large variety of user profiles to be efficient and successful in their role, and those frustrating interactions had a tangible negative impact on their working life. As designers, this meant a couple of inherent complexities:

                            <li> <b>Varying contexts and usages:</b> the web app could be used on a bad quality screen, for several hours throughout the day, in a badly lit office, or on the go, on a smartphone, to confirm one transaction, for example.</li>

                            <li> <b>Limited access to users:</b> because some users were "VIP" corporate clients and couldn't be interviewed or surveyed, there were gaps in our user knowledge.

                        In an effort to identify those blind spots, I created the template for the following matrix and filled it up with all the user insights I had gathered, from the general (e.g. mid corp users, accountants) to the specific (e.g. an accountant in a midcorp), differentiating analytics and research from assumptions.

                        I then passed it on to user researchers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevensglenn/" target="_blank">Glenn Stevens</a> and <a href="https://be.linkedin.com/in/maximederoeck" target="_blank">Maxime Deroeck</a>, who conducted user interviews in order to fill the gaps and verify assumptions.

                         While I worked on several projects over the course of my year at Belfius, I'd like to highlight this one for several reasons: it was rooted on user needs, I pushed for it and served both as a project manager and ux designer, and it had the most impact. 

                        </br></br>

                        One of the first thing I noticed when logging into BelfiusWeb was that the first page failed to provide any added value. Research and web analytics confirmed that users perceived it as an unnecessary step.

                        The usability evaluation and users interviews had also pointed to the need to evolve towards a clearer and task-based information architecture: users come to
                        BelfiusWeb to perform a task (make a payment, sign a transaction, import a
                        file, check a balance,...). Some of which are repetitive, some periodic. Some
                        of those tasks go together and need to be linked. Some 
                        always require the same information to be completed. Some will be performed
                        primarily by a specific group of users. Etc. <b>Our findings, as well as competitive analysis, therefore hinted at a demand for a task-oriented, personalized dashboard.</b></br>

                       More specifically, <b>we wanted to offer a clear, functional and personalized dashboard to facilitate users’ workflow by: highlighting urgent actions that need taking care of, allowing them to quickly complete frequently accessed tasks, enabling them to monitor key information at a glance and offering curated and relevant content.</b> Our goal was to increase users’ satisfaction and loyalty by, on one hand, making the executing staff more successful in their role and, on the other hand, providing value and creating trust for the decision makers. We would know this to be true when seeing an increase in both the frequency and depth of use of BelfiusWeb.

                            I had to do a lot of convincing and stakeholder management to launch this project, as this was not on the roadmap, and Belfius was still operating in a top-down approach when it came to design priorities. 

                        </br></br>

                        To do so, I involved the whole team, as well as external experts (corporate bankers and customer support team) in a process of co-creation.<b>In total, I facilitated 4 workshops to: define the business value of the idea (impact map), better understand the users’ needs and workflow (provisional personas), generate ideas and determine the ideal vision state, prioritize our ideas and agree on intermediary steps (impact vs effort matrix)</b>  </br></br> </br> </br>

                       At the end of the second exercice, we had 3 profiles with specific but different tasks and needs, yet all using the same tool with the same request: <b>to only see what’s relevant for them, with as little unnecessary steps and clutter as possible.</b></p>

                    We therefore moved to the ideation exercice with those questions in mind:

                    <ul class="list-style-3 text-medium line-height-30 padding-20px-left">
                        <li>  How might we facilitate the users’ recurring tasks? </li>
                        
                        <li>   How might we meet the users’ personalization needs?</li>

                        <li> How might we prompt the users to connect every day to BelfiusWeb?
                        </li>
                        <li>  How might we continuously provide content that’s relevant to each user?
                        </li>
                    

                    </ul>
                </br></br>
                <p class="text-medium line-height-30">

                  After the final workshop, we had defined the vision and quick-wins. While the goal was to provide relevant content and anticipate users' needs, we would start with a dashboard that could be manually personalized and that'd include: shortcuts to top tasks, recent activity (alerts, notifications, documents to sign,…), an overview on relevant accounts and communications from the bank.  The second step would be to offer decision makers an actionable overview of the company's financial health and growth with relevant KPIs.
                  
                </br></br>
I went back to my laptop to design the initial concepts. There was a lot of back and forth over the next couple of months. I collaborated with the marketing team and UI designer <a href="https://www.behance.net/swinchri/appreciated" target="_blank">Christian Swinnen</a> to arrive at the final UI, as well as the research team to verify our assumptions and better define users' key tasks and workflows. I also worked closely with IT and Data to ensure the solution was future-proof. And I had to frequently validate the direction with the management team, as well as with the legal and security teams. Until, at last the final version was launched, with a lot of positive feedback from the users.

                            My mission at Belfius lasted a year and it is to date the one I found the most interesting and challenging. Processes were slow, the meetings long, the politics complicated and I had to work hard to prove the value of shifting towards a more user-centric approach. But looking back, I thrived in the complexity and the autonomy, I got to be challenged by brilliant UXers and work with finance experts. I learned a lot about stakeholder management and how to communicate design decisions. It helps that I received, and still do, positive feedback from both users and former coworkers.
