                    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> Belfius is the leading Belgian bank, and their private banking app ranks high with customers,  thanks to a great design team. 
                    </br></br> 
                However, one department was having issues: the PCB team, who develops and maintains the digital solutions for corporate and public banking. They had been collaborating with an external agency to redesign their web app for the past 2 years. It should be noted that we're talking about a platform that people in various financial roles (accountants, CFO's, investments managers,…) and in companies ranging from small local businesses to multimillion international corporations need to use to complete their daily tasks. An unclear navigation or poor user experience therefore means time lost during the work day, constant frustration for the employees and real financial consequences for our clients. 
             </br></br> 
            Unfortunately, the redesign had prioritized the look and feel, with little to no consideration for user needs and context. The big launch was not going as planned: users were confused by the new version of BelfiusWeb, the support team was receiving calls everyday and corporate clients weren't happy. </p>
    
    <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> 
          That's when I was brought on board. It was the first time a UX designer would work with this team and on this product.
                 </br>       </br> 
For a month, I mostly observed. I worked on small design tasks, while getting to know the many stakeholders, asking many questions to the user researchers and the customers support team, learning from the domain experts and familiarizing myself with the complex and multilayered platform. It became obvious that the product reflected the team organization: different stakeholders with varying visions were working in silos, domain and user knowledge was scattered accross departments, and a proper design process needed to be formalized.

First, I got the team together, with some key external stakeholders, so they could define five design principles for BelfiusWeb. Not only was this a fun workshop to facilitate, it created a shared design vision that everyone felt they could own, introduced a different way of working and proved tremendously helpful with decision making later on.

designing a professional tool such as BelfiusWeb: the fact that end users are not always
involved in the buying decision but will end up using the platform repeatedly in order to
achieve very specific tasks, that the same tool should enable a wide variety of profiles to all
be efficient and successful in their role, or that disruptive flows and frustrating interactions
cost time and have a tangible negative impact on people’s working life.

                         several issues ivnesting dashboard etc but what came back most often in the research was We conducted 4 workshops to: 
Define the business value of our idea, with an impact map. 
Better understand the users’ needs and workflow by creating provisional personas. 
Generate ideas and determine  the ideal vision state. 
Prioritize our ideas and agree on intermediary steps, with an impact vs effort matrix. </p>

                          <p class="text-medium line-height-30">
                      We chose to prioritize three profiles of users:

Decision Makers: Responsables Entités (Overall Growth) 
Decision Makers: Responsables Financiers (Financial Health) 
Executing Staff (Daily banking) 

Then, with the help of corporate bankers and e-consultants, we created provisional personas for each of those categories (= our best guesses as to who our users are, how they’re using BW and what their goals and pain points are, without having done proper user research)</p>

                                    <li> At the end of the exercise, we realized that we had 4 profiles with very specific and very different tasks and needs, but all using the same tool and all having the same request: to only see what’s relevant for them, with as little unnecessary steps and content as possible. 
Based on this knowledge, we moved on to an ideation exercice, to answer those 4 questions: 
How might we facilitate the users’ recurring tasks? 
How might we meet the users’ personalization needs?
How might we prompt the users to connect every day to BelfiusWeb?
How might we continuously provide content that’s relevant to each user?</li>

                                    <li> We defined quick wins and big projects, and identified three steps:

First, we’ll create a dashboard that the users can personalize themselves and that includes: shortcuts to top tasks, recent activity (alerts, notifications, documents to sign,…), an overview on relevant accounts, etc. It’ll focus on facilitating the daily tasks of the executing staff. 
Then, we'll shift the focus to providing added value to the decision makers, offering them an actionable overview of the company's financial health and growth with relevant KPIs 
The long term vision is to provide a feed of relevant content and to anticipate users’ needs

As we go along, we’ll learn more about the users and offer more customization..</li>

                    We need to validate our assumptions and research the unknowns in three areas:

UX: We will need to validate the users’ key tasks and workflow, as well as better define the various profiles, to ensure the dashboard actually creates value. 
Data and IT: How to identify users’ profiles? How to capture the user's preferences? How to stock and use them to show relevant content? etc. We need to answer those quickly, to create a future-proof solution from the beginning.

Communication: Where will the content come from?</p>

                            My mission at Belfius lasted a year and it is to date the one I found the most interesting and challenging. Processes were slow, the meetings long, the politics complicated and I had to work hard to prove the value of shifting towards a more user-centric approach. But looking back, I trhived while challenged and soundwall by great designers working on others projects the complexit of the problems and learned about stakeholder management and design communications.  feedback and people expert in their field, having worked in finances for decades. It helps that i got, and still do, receive positive feedback on the project we worked for.I learned a lot about the environments i thrive in, loved complex problems the autonomy of taking initiative while having access to brilliant designers working on other projects for soundboard or being challenged.
