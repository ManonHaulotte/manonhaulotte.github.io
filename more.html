Mental health was an important topic to me since teenager years, having seen people close to me in the grip of depression, myself going through the difficult times of your brain lying to you. 

In 2017-2018, I moved to Toronto, Canada. It’s hard to know how experience change you while they happen. Something became clear as I returned to Belgium (first those scooters had appeared together and that was weird). Maybe lucky or maybe the culture there, but I had stated opening up about my mental health, at work, my manager asking me to manage my stress discovering « mental health days » (waw), someone talking about their anxiety in a bar, nationwide campaigns lets talk,… It has left an impression on me i only realized when i came home, adapted that. 

People thanked me. Just mentioned. Always afterwards, always when alone. Opened up, shared with me. 

I started wondering in the back of my head about how we can get these discussions out of 

Cue to a year later, and everything is locking down and we’re working from home. Connecting becomes a buzzword and burn out just the weekly news. 


I asked question. On my socials first, then expanded. People were candid and open in those anonymous and same direction: we want to talk about it. But how? 

I didn’t have a degree qualifying. I’m not a therapist. But what I’m fascinated with is difficult conversations. The way we muddling though them, the moments of vulnerability that unlock them, the way someone says something and you know you’re not alone. Question 

When things eased of, I tested. I took cards i wrote questions on them. I must have iterate through hundreds of questions. 

It was then that I got lucky to be accepted by StartLAB, the key incubator in Brussels. Challenged me at every step, networks of entrepreneurs with amazing projects, coach and mentors. 

I experienced and refined the rules. Organized games, set up an online presence (instagram and tiktok), it was all new. 

Didn’t have to scale it and for a business model that makes sens, id have to have it made in china, which i was against. 

The project is sleeping i realized i couldn’t carry on my own, I learned about myself that as much as i fantasize about the entrepreneur life, I like a team, I like bouncing ideas off people, and I’m no good to handle orders and. I’m proud for the dozens of discussions it sparked, I’m proud that knew when to stop. I’m glad that here and there, when a friend is down, i get those cards and we don’t have to think our way and be supported by them to get us where it’s scary to go darker less travelled place indicated ronces 

1 - Apporter de la nuance à un discours sur la santé mentale souvent trop médicalisé, stigmatisant, négatif - ou inexistant.

2 - Retisser le lien social et recréer un sentiment d'appartenance dans des situations où la honte, la solitude, l'isolement et l'impression d'être incompris dominent.

3 - Déclencher des conversations essentielles et difficiles.

4 - Offrir un outil de plus dans la boite à outil que nous développons au fur et à mesure de nos vies pour faire face aux périodes plus sombres.

**La vision** 

Si je vois plus loin, j'aimerais qu'un jour  parler de nos santés mentales devienne quelque chose qui nous connecte,  que ça devienne aussi normal de dire ”ça ne va pas bien dans ma tete pour le moment” ”mon cerveau fait des siennes” ”je prend des médicaments pour mon anxiété” ”je reste chez moi, je me sens depressive”. 

"Normalize awkward conversations"

Where we stumble 


La santé mentale est au cœur des discussions de la génération 18-25. Celle qu’on appelle déjà la “génération covid”. Nous sommes passés d’un sujet complètement tabou, nié, minimisé, à une discussion générationnelle. Si le climat ambiant montre tous les enjeux liés au sujet, cette discussion a commencé bien avant la crise sanitaire. Il suffit de voir le nombre de réponses reçues lors de notre appel à témoignage : les jeunes s’intéressent à leur santé mentale et n’ont pas peur d’en parler. Nous pouvons aussi jeter un œil aux réseaux sociaux : les comptes             Instagram d’accompagnement fleurissent. Des jeunes vlogguent leurs moments sombres sur YouTube. D’autres ont fait du sujet un trend sur TikTok. Bref, c’est un sujet primordial.

The climbing rate of depression are without question the consequence of modernity. The pace of life, the technological chaos of it, the alienation of people from one another, the breakdown of traditional family structure, the loneliness that is endemic the failure of systems of belief (religions moral political social anything that seemed to give meaning and direction to life) have been catastrophic. Fortunately we have developed systems for coping with the problem. We have medications that dress the organic disturbances and therapies that address the emotional upheavals of chronic disease. Depression is an increasing cost of our society but its not ruinous we have the psychological equivalents of sunscreen and baseball hats and shade. But do we have the equivalent of an environmental movement? A system to contain the damages we are doing to the social ozone layer?

                          After creating personas, an experience map and user stories, I had more clarity on the future features and flow of the app. It would offer a <b>curated selection </b>of papers, based on the user's interest and reading history. The content itself would be written in <b>everyday English</b>,  with definitions for the more complex concepts, and distilled to the  <b>main findings</b>. There would be  <b>several opportunities to engage</b> with the material, such as: creating collections, sharing a paper, highlighting sentences, personalising the format of the text, asking questions to the researcher, discussing findings with the community, etc. </p>

                                    <li> The Home Page ("Discover") is an important one, as it should make users feel curious but not overwhelmed. I started with a very simple list, which people found too cluttered and not inspiring. I then tried a carousel, to focus on one paper at the time, with little success: it was confusing and cumbersome. I ended up with something in between: the user can scroll down to see different sections, and swipe for the papers within each categories. The feedback was positive: this layout was intuitive and well-organised. Thanks to the testings, I also learned what information actually needed to be on this page: the reading time and the option to pick up where you left off were appreciated, while the year of publication and tags were just cluttering the screen. Finally, I realised that the "Read" button wasn't necessary, because with well-designed interface the users would intuitively click on the card.</li>
                                        
                                       <li> I spent a lot of time trying and testing different layouts for the paper itself, to ensure it was enjoyable to read and easy to understand. One of the main learning outcome was that people like the ability to customize their reading experience (font, size, background colour,...), so I opted for a minimalist default layout, with sufficient spacing. Beside, while my first design was an overwhelming one-page text, the response was much better for the final option: each page presents one main idea/concept, the user can swipe from one page to the next, and a bar at the bottom indicates progress. People also loved the option to get a definition by clicking on a term, without having to leave the paper page.
                                </li>

                                    <li> A big hurdle with the two first prototypes was learnability. I therefore carefully read Apple's Human Interface Guidelines before designing the final prototype, to make sure the app looked familiar and users didn't have to learn new pattern.

                        The final feedback was very enthusiastic: people confirmed that they would use the app, appreciated the intutive interface and felt immersed in the paper: “<i>It can take so long sometimes to get to the relevant part in a paper, I like that this is short and straight to the point, but not too superficial </i>”.</p>

                        <p class="text-medium line-height-30"> When it was time to pick a name, colours, typefaces and an illustration style, I made sure it reflected what the app was about: simplicity, discovery, community. As academia is often perceived to be obscure and intimadating, I wanted a brand that appeared friendly and modern, but also trustworthy.  </p>

                        <p class="text-medium line-height-30">  This is what I aimed to convey on the marketing website as well, with a minimalist layout, one-line illustrations and clear explanations. While we were only asked to design the page, I wanted to bring biblio to life and decided to code it. Although the result is far from perfect, as I only had two days to work on it, I enjoyed the challenge and people liked interacting with the website when we showcased our projects.
